My work falls into both landscapes of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra where I utilize the machinery
of derived categories to understand problems lying within these two subject matters. This direction
of research has interactions with singularity theory, and in essence the objective is to understand the behavior
through homological methods coming from derived categories. Broadly speaking, I am interested in
problems regarding the applications of derived categories in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.
